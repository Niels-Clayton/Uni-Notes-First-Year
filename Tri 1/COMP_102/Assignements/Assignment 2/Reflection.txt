Questions for Reflection:
=========================

1. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to the
previous assignment? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

    In the previous assignment when attempting the paint calculator challenge
    I tried to use loops, but I was not very successful and I never got them to work.
    In both 'date validator', and in 'CartoonCharacter' I used loops. In date validator
    I used them to apply different 'if/else' statements to different months, and in CartoonCharacter
    I used loops in order to make the characters move more fluidly. I did this as the
    '.walk' command would make the character instantly jump to the new position rather than move.
    To overcome this I created a loop that move the character one pixel at a time.
    This then created the issue that the screen would only update every 500ms,
    so in the "CartoonCharacter" class I edited UI.sleep(500), and changed it to
    UI.sleep(3), meaning that the screen would update every 3ms.

    The use of loops was much easier in this assignment as I had a greater understanding
    of Boolean logic, and I understood the difference between a Boolean statement, and
    a parameter.


2. Why did the dance method have to have a parameter (the CartoonCharacter face
parameter)?

    The dance method had the parameter (CartoonCharacter face) because the method
    didn't have an object for it to call actions on. The dance method was only a set
    of general instructions to be applied to a 'CartoonCharacter', and it needed
    for there to be a 'CartoonCharacter' within the method that was calling it.
    Because an existing 'CartoonCharacter' is required for the dance method,
    it is a parameter.

3. When using several "if" statements, you can use a sequence of separate "if"
statements or you can combine them into a longer "if... else if .... else if ...."
statement.  What's the difference, and which is better?

    When using a sequence of separate 'if' statements, If your input matches more
    that one of the 'if' statements you will get multiple outputs. However when doing
    the longer 'if... else if... else' statements, you will only get one output as it
    will halt as soon as one of the if statements is met.

    The longer 'if... else if...' statements are better as they allow you to be more
    accurate with what the output will be. However a sequence of separate 'if'
    statements might be more useful in cases where you want to see all the outputs
    the statements will fit into.
