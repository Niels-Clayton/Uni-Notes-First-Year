Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

1. For the Core of ImageRenderer, you didn't need to use
while(scan.hasNext()), but for the Completion (animated images) you did need to
use while(scan.hasNext()). Explain the difference.
_______________________________________________________________________________________
with the core, the file would only contain one image, because of this we can assume that
once the initial non-Integer tokens have been read the rest of the file will be integers, else 
we have reached the end of the file and can close the scanner. However, with the animated 
images the file would contain many different frames of the image which would each need to be 
drawn one after the other. because of this we need to constantly check if the file has more
information to be read and drawn. This is done by including the while(scan.hasNext()) loop.


2. If an image was standard SVGA size (800x600), how big might a ppm file of the
image be, given that each character in the file (including the spaces) requires
1 byte?  How much worse is this than a typical jpg or png file of the same
number of pixels?  (you may need to go and find some typical images that are
about 800x600 pixels).
 
each ppm fild begins with 4 tokens, P3, width and height, and colour depth. 
In the case of a 800x600 image that would total 12characters just for the description 
of the file. the file would then contain 480,000 pixels, each requiring 3 tokens of 
information or 9 characters plus 3 spaces, totaling 12bytes per pixel. 
in total this would mean that a standard colour depth ppm image of 800x600 could 
have a file size of up to 5,760,012 bytes or around 5.8 megabytes.
