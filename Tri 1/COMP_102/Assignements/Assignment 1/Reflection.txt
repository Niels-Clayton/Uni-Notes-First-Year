Questions for Reflection:
=========================

Almost certainly, when you wrote your code, you had bugs in it which you had to
fix. Some of the bugs were probably easy to identify; others probably took more
time.

1. Characterize the kinds of bugs you had to deal with (eg spelling, punctuation, ...)

I found myself forgetting to put a semi-colon at the end of each line of code. I also
treated the value 'Top'as a variable to describe dimensions of my symbol rather than
a constant displacement.

2. What techniques for fixing the bugs were most effective for you? Can you
think of better approaches that you could use next time?

As I became more familiar with coding in java I began to remember to end each line with
a semicolon, so I believe that with more practice I will not encounter this issue anymore.
The same is true with my incorrect usage of the value 'top'. As I progressed through the
assessment I encountered this issue less and began using the correct value 'height'.
