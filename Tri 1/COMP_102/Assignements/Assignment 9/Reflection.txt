Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. Some of the methods in the ImageProcessor program could be done in two
different ways: "in-place" (only using the array containing the image), or
using a temporary array to store the image as it was being processed. Discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches. 

By using a temporary array you keep all of the information in the original array intact, this means that you wont have to deal with the
issue of overwriting information that you need to keep. This however has the downside of being both slower then a direct switch as each element 
must first be copied into a new array and then copied back, and it will require a greater percentage of the system resources, as it will need to 
store twice the information.
