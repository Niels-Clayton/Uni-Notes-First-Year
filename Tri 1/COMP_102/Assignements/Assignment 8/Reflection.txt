Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. Explain why "off-by-one" errors are so easy to make when programming with
arrays.

"off-by-one" errors are easy to make when working with arrays because when using a loop if you set the counter 
to the incorrect number then you will go out of the bounds of the array. This however is easy to deal with by using 
a for loop with a counter starting at 0, this is and getting the loop to count till less than 'array.size()', and since they 
both start at position 0 then this will always run to the end of the array.

2. Both DominoGame and EarthquakeAnalyser used another class that was written for you.
This saved you writing some code, but also constrained you to write the program in a particular way. 
Discuss advantages and disadvantages you found when having a predefined class that you had to use as part of your program.

The predefined classes for DominoGame and EarthquakeAnalyser made coding much easier, specifically in terms of doing complicated 
calculations. In EarthquakeAnalyser the timeBetween, and getDistance methods make the calculation from cordiantes to km, far easier.
Because of this I was saved a large amount of time doing these calculations myself, and writing my own method. 
Similarly, in dominoGame the drawDomino method made the drawing of dominos far more simplistic. 
The disadvantages of having a predefined class could be that you have to write your program around the given methods, however there 
is nothing stopping you from writing you own methods inside of the DominoGame class, so personally i can't see any dissadvantages.
