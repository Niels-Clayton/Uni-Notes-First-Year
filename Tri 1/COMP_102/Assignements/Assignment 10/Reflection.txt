Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

This was the last assignment for COMP102.  Think back to the beginning of the
course and what you knew at that point, and then list some of the new skills
and understanding that you believe that you have gained during this course.


[For some of you who are still finding the course difficult, you could
try doing some of the early assignments again; you may find them an awful lot
easier the second time round, demonstrating that you have learned stuff!]
